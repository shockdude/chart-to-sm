# Chart to SM converter
Roughly convert Clone Hero charts to simfiles for Stepmania 5.3 Outfox's Guitar mode

Usage: Drag-and-drop the chart file or chart folder onto `chart-to-sm.exe` \
Or use the command line: `python chart-to-sm.py notes.chart`

Extremely hacky with barely any error handling, but should work for most CH chart folders \
containing a `notes.chart` and a `song.ini`
